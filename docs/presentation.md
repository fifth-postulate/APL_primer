# APL born out of necessity
# Mathematical background
# Business application

---

## Notation as a tool of thought
 
* Ease of expressing constructs arising in problems.
* Suggestivity.
* Ability to subordinate detail.
* Economy.
* Amenability to formal proofs.

# What does this do? 
# Sum of Squares

```java
package nl.fifth_postulate;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Verbose2 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	    int[] data = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};

        int sum =
                Arrays.stream(data)
                .map(n -> n*n)
                .sum();

        System.out.println(String.format("sum = %d", sum));
    }

# Better with stream API
# Still verbose
# Java isn't the best language

# Should be skeptical
# Try APL
